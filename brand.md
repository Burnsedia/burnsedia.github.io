# Bailey Burnsed / Burnsedia Brand Identity v1

## 1) Brand Core

### Brand Name
- Bailey Burnsed (personal authority)
- Burnsedia (creator/dev identity)

### Brand Thesis
I build high-quality apps, indie games, and open tools that don't suck, with transparent engineering standards and practical execution.

### Mission
Build software people actually enjoy using: fast, useful, ethical apps and games with no anti-pattern bloat, while growing an audience-funded creator ecosystem around real build-in-public work.

### Vision
Build a fully open-source software company and a trusted indie engineering/media brand where developers, artists, enthusiasts, and founders come for implementation truth over hype.

### Core Promise
Real builds. Real constraints. Real outcomes.
No spyware. No vaporware. No bloatware.

## 2) Positioning

### Category
Indie software engineer + indie game builder + open-source creator + premium B2B systems builder.

### Market Position
Audience-first creator brand with premium technical depth, blending:
- devlogs
- deep technical teardowns
- game/art build process
- open-source tooling progress

### Differentiator
Most creators only show finished outcomes. This brand shows decisions, tradeoffs, constraints, failures, and implementation details that help people build better software.

### Anti-Positioning
- No generic productivity fluff
- No fake corporate/startup persona
- No shallow trend-chasing tech news
- No anti-consumer product choices
- No anti-pattern engineering defaults

---

## 3) Audience

### Primary Audience
Indie builders and enthusiast users: indie game developers, open-source enthusiasts, indie artists, and retro-future sci-fi fans who actively want high-quality apps and games and enjoy supporting tools they use.

### Secondary Audience
Founders and operators who need high-ticket B2B SaaS execution and fully automated done-for-you services.

### Audience Need
Reliable, no-bloat software and practical technical guidance from a creator who ships in public and documents real engineering decisions.

### Audience Outcome
They discover the work, follow the journey, support through Patreon/GitHub Sponsors, use the products, and a qualified subset buys premium B2B services.

## 5) Japanese-Inspired Brand Framework (Applied)

### Ikigai (Strategic Center)
- Love: building apps/games/tools
- Skill: senior engineering execution
- Need: quality software and practical guidance
- Sustain: Patreon, GitHub Sponsors, selective high-ticket work

### Ki-Sho-Ten-Ketsu (Narrative Model)
Use this structure for devlogs/tutorials:
1. Setup (problem/context)
2. Development (approach)
3. Twist (unexpected issue/pivot)
4. Resolution (result + lesson)

### Shu-Ha-Ri (Craft Standard)
- Shu: apply proven patterns
- Ha: adapt to context
- Ri: publish your own frameworks/tooling patterns

### Ma + Kanso (Design Discipline)
- Ma: intentional whitespace and pacing
- Kanso: clean hierarchy, no visual noise

## 6) Visual Identity (Retro Synthwave)

### Visual Direction
Retro synthwave with disciplined UX. Neon atmosphere, production-grade readability.

### Color Behavior
- Dark base surfaces
- Neon accent highlights (used intentionally, not everywhere)
- High-contrast text for long-form readability
- One primary accent action per screen

### Typography Behavior
- Clear hierarchy with generous heading contrast
- Comfortable body text line length
- Avoid overly decorative fonts for paragraphs

### UI Style
- Panel-based sections with subtle glow edges
- Rounded cards with consistent depth system
- Strong CTA contrast and spacing rhythm

### Motion Style
- Subtle reveal/stagger
- Minimal hover/focus transitions
- Motion supports hierarchy, never distracts

## 7) Messaging Pillars

1. **Build in Public**
   - Weekly progress, transparent process, shipping momentum.

2. **Engineering Integrity**
   - Architecture decisions, anti-pattern avoidance, practical tradeoffs.

3. **Open Source + Commercial Reality**
   - Sustainable creator economics without compromising technical quality.

4. **Creative Tech Fusion**
   - Apps, games, tools, and art pipeline in one coherent maker identity.

---

## 8) Content Strategy Alignment

### Primary Engine
Hybrid devlogs (apps, games, OSS, and art process) with practical implementation notes.

### Secondary Engine
Deep technical teardowns that position senior capability for both builders and B2B buyers.

### Optional Layer
Curated tech commentary only when it includes clear builder takeaways and execution implications.

### Publishing Cadence (Current)
- One major post per month (devlog or tutorial), published as written + video.
- Public summary on-site with full deep-dive available to supporters when relevant.
- Weekly Friday public live build + patron-only aftershow.
- Monthly patron-only livestream (mixed AMA, roadmap, and teardown).

### Channel Rule
- X/YouTube/Twitch/TikTok: ongoing build narrative
- LinkedIn: polished technical teardown only

---

## 9) Conversion Identity

### Primary CTA (Current Phase)
Support my work (Patreon first, GitHub Sponsors second).

### Conversion Ladder

2. Watch public devlog
3. Support (Patreon/GitHub Sponsors)
4. Join supporter community
5. Buy products (apps, games, assets)
6. Optional high-ticket B2B work (separate offer)

### Offer Separation Rule

## 11) Brand Do / Don't

### Do
- Show your process and receipts.
- Teach through actual work artifacts.
- Keep visual consistency across sections/pages.
- Be explicit about who you build for and why.

### Don't
- Rebrand tone for corporate approval.
- Overload pages with equal-priority CTAs.
- Publish generic news summaries without opinion.
- Hide failures; they are trust assets.

---

## 12) Signature Lines (Working)

- Build in public. Ship software that doesn't suck.
- Real builds, real tradeoffs, real outcomes.
- Open tools. Commercial discipline. Indie execution.
- Senior engineering, minus the anti-patterns.

---

## 13) Implementation Priorities (Design + Brand)

1. Standardize spacing, typography, and button hierarchy across key templates.
2. Add consistent support CTA modules in header, home, blog, and footer.
3. Launch `/support` and `/socials` as brand-conversion hubs.
4. Add gallery flow with consistent visual system and itch integration.
5. Instrument conversion events and refine based on data.

---

## 14) Brand Governance

Review monthly:
- Is content still practical and specific?
- Is visual hierarchy consistent on mobile and desktop?
- Are CTAs aligned to current business phase?
- Is the tone still builder-honest and not drifting corporate?
