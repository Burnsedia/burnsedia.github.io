## 13) Implementation Priorities (Design + Brand)

1. Standardize spacing, typography, and button hierarchy across key templates.
2. Add consistent support CTA modules in header, home, blog, and footer.
3. Launch `/support` and `/socials` as brand-conversion hubs.
4. Add gallery flow with consistent visual system and itch integration.
5. Instrument conversion events and refine based on data.

## 14) Brand Governance

Review monthly:
- Is content still practical and specific?
- Is visual hierarchy consistent on mobile and desktop?
- Are CTAs aligned to current business phase?
- Is the tone still builder-honest and not drifting corporate?
