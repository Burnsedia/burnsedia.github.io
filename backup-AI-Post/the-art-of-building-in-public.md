# The Art of Building in Public

## 1️⃣ Story: How Transparency Became My Strategy

When I started sharing my work online, I wasn’t trying to “go viral.”  
I was just documenting what I was already doing — fixing bugs, deploying apps, shipping features.

Then something unexpected happened.  
People started following my updates, DMing me questions, and asking about freelance work.  

I realized that **transparency sells**.  
When you build in public, you turn your daily work into a story that others can follow, learn from, and support.  
You stop *telling* people you can build — you *show* them.



## 2️⃣ List: Why Building in Public Works

### 🎯 1. It Creates Authentic Trust
People don’t trust ads — they trust stories.  
By sharing your work-in-progress, you prove that you actually build.  
They see the process, not just the polish.

### 🧱 2. It Builds Community
When you share consistently, you attract developers, founders, and potential clients who resonate with your journey.  
That’s not an “audience.” That’s a **network** that grows with you.

### 📈 3. It Turns Process Into Marketing
Every milestone, commit, and mistake becomes content.  
You don’t need to force ideas — your day-to-day dev life *is* the content.  
“Fixed a deploy bug today” can turn into “How to debug Docker on Fly.io.”

### 🧠 4. It Improves Your Thinking
Writing about your code forces you to explain it clearly.  
And when you can explain your process, you understand it better.

### 💬 5. It Converts Followers Into Clients
When people watch you build something real, they want to be part of it.  
You become the default expert in your niche because you’re visible, consistent, and transparent.



## 3️⃣ Steps: How to Build in Public Without Burning Out

### Step 1 — Start Small
You don’t need a daily vlog or threads.  
Just share one update a day:
> “Just finished optimizing Django queries — cut load time in half.”

### Step 2 — Use a Simple Format
Post using the “Story → List → Steps” pattern:
1. Story: What happened  
2. List: What you learned  
3. Steps: How others can do it  

That’s easy, structured, and readable across platforms.

### Step 3 — Show, Don’t Tell
Post screenshots, code snippets, or progress GIFs.  
People connect more with *evidence* than claims.

### Step 4 — Embrace Imperfection
Share bugs, rewrites, and pivots.  
Perfection is boring — progress is relatable.

### Step 5 — Engage Back
Reply to comments, share feedback, and uplift others building in public.  
You’re not broadcasting — you’re collaborating.



## 4️⃣ Platforms That Work

- 🧵 **Twitter/X** → For daily updates, threads, and quick wins  
- 💼 **LinkedIn** → For longer insights and client-oriented storytelling  
- 🧠 **GitHub** → For proof of work (commits, issues, PRs)  
- 📰 **Your Blog (Astro)** → For long-form evergreen posts  
- 🎥 **YouTube (optional)** → For tutorials and dev logs  

Each platform feeds the other — Twitter builds awareness, GitHub proves skill, and your blog closes the deal.



## 5️⃣ My Personal Workflow

Here’s how I manage my “build in public” process:
1. Ship features daily (client work, BulkPost, or side projects)  
2. Post one daily update or mini-thread on X  
3. Write one long-form post weekly on my Astro blog  
4. Archive key lessons into tutorials for YouTube and Udemy  
5. Cross-link everything back to [baileyburnsed.dev](https://baileyburnsed.dev)

That consistency compounds.  
Each post builds credibility.  
Each repo builds visibility.  
Each article builds authority.



## 6️⃣ Lessons Learned

- You don’t need viral reach — you need **visible progress**.  
- People follow **momentum**, not perfection.  
- Building in public forces you to stay accountable.  
- Transparency turns your workflow into your marketing.
