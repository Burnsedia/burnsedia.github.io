## When the Editor Became the Bottleneck

I type fast.  
So fast that VS Code couldn’t keep up. It kept freezing, crashing, lagging.  

At first I thought it was my extensions. Then my laptop.  
Turns out, it was me.  

When you start moving faster than your tools, you’ve outgrown them.  

That’s when I switched to **Vim**, then **Neovim**.  
No UI lag, no crashes, just text and speed. It’s on every one of my servers.  

The deeper I went into the command line, the more I realized:  
> The best tools aren’t the easiest ones — they’re the ones that reward skill.

Once you taste that power, you start chasing it.  
You stop downloading plugins for comfort and start learning commands for control.  
And before you know it, you’ve joined a cult of high-efficiency weirdos who can out-code entire teams from a terminal window.

## 10 Tools Developers Obsess Over

**1. Neovim** — The hacker’s editor. Lua plugins, LSP, no nonsense. Once you configure it, it feels like an extension of your hands.  

**2. Git** — Not just version control, but a way of thinking. Branches, rebases, bisects - it rewires your brain to track change like a machine.  

**3. Ollama** — Run LLMs locally, offline, privately. The open-source antidote to cloud-based AI.  

**4. LazyGit** — A TUI for Git that makes merges fun again. Everything you need, nothing you don’t.  

**5. LazyDocker** — Manage containers visually from the terminal. Because not every dev wants to memorize `docker ps` flags.  

**6. fzf** — Fuzzy-find anything. Files, history, branches. The closest thing to autocomplete for your brain.  

**7. ripgrep (`rg`)** — The lightning-fast search engine for codebases. `grep` walked so `ripgrep` could run.  

**8. zoxide** — Type two letters and teleport anywhere you’ve been. Your terminal becomes omnipresent.  

**9. bat** — A modern `cat` with syntax highlighting and line numbers. Beautiful, functional, addictive.  

**10. tmux** — Split terminals, persist sessions, automate environments. Real developers don’t close terminals; they detach them.

## How to Join the Cult (Without Burning Out)

**Step 1 – Pick one.**  
Don’t install all the cool tools you find at once. Pick one tool and live in it for a week.

**Step 2 – Read the docs.**  
Not a YouTube tutorial — the *actual* documentation.  
Every secret shortcut lives there.

**Step 3 – Replace your old habit.**  
If you usually open VS Code, open Neovim.  
If you `cd` into folders, use zoxide.  
Muscle memory rewires faster through replacement, not addition.

**Step 4 – Customize everything.**  
Add keybindings, themes, and aliases that match your rhythm.  
Tools become powerful when they disappear into your flow.

**Step 5 – Teach it.**  
Record a demo, write a blog, or explain it to a friend.  
If you can teach it clearly, you’ve mastered it completely.

## Personal Take

You can’t fake mastery.  

The terminal is the great equalizer — it doesn’t care about your degree, or your job title.  
You either know your tools or you don’t.  

I’ve always believed that **becoming a power user** is the real rite of passage for developers.  
The command line is the gateway drug to *becoming a god of machines.*
