# The $5 Fly.io Stack — Deploying Django and Vue for Indie Founders

## Hosting on a Budget

When I started freelancing full-time, I didn’t have corporate cloud budgets.  
AWS bills were unpredictable, and Heroku’s free tier was dying.  
So I went hunting for something simple, fast, and cheap.

That’s when I found **Fly.io.**  
Today, I deploy full Django + Vue apps for **$5/month.**

## What Makes Fly.io Perfect for Indie Developers

### 1. Simple Global Deployments
Fly.io lets you deploy anywhere in the world with one command.  
Your app lives *close to your users* automatically.

### 2. Docker-First by Design
If it runs in Docker, it runs on Fly.io.  
That means less configuration, fewer headaches, and reproducible builds.

### 3. Built-in PostgreSQL
Fly has managed Postgres baked right in.  
You can scale it up or down without touching AWS-style networking nightmares.

### 4. Built for Small Teams
Fly’s CLI and dashboard are simple.  
No 50-step setup or IAM jungles — just deploy, scale, and go.

### 5. Predictable Pricing
The free tier gives you small VMs, and $5/month covers most indie apps.  
You only pay for what you actually use.

## My $5 Deployment Workflow

### Step 1 — Build a Dockerfile
Every project I build starts with a simple Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["gunicorn", "core.wsgi:application", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8080"]
```

### Step 2 — Initialize Fly
```bash
fly launch
```
Pick your region, set environment variables, and it auto-generates your config.

### Step 3 — Add PostgreSQL
```bash
fly postgres create
```
Then connect it in your Django settings with:
```python
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")
```

### Step 4 — Deploy Frontend
Build your Vue app, then serve it through Django static files or on a second Fly app.

### Step 5 — Monitor and Scale
Fly gives you free metrics and auto-scaling.  
You can run an entire SaaS on one small VM.

## The Big Idea: Ship More, Spend Less

Infrastructure shouldn’t eat your profits.  
The cheaper your stack, the longer your runway — and the faster you can iterate.

Fly.io proves that great software doesn’t need great budgets.
