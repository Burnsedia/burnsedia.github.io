# Problem (TLDR I hate social media and I need it for marketing)

I hate social media with a passion. It seems fake, fraudulent, and van. 
Unfortunately for us introverted autistic nerds it is a business nosesity these days 

So I begain researching ways to social media platforms for my marketing. I settled on Twtter, Instagram and Linkedin.

I have not gotton any leads from Instagram or Linkedin that I was not convensed were humans. Twitter on the other hand has a verications system that I can be resonalbe confite in.

Ferther more, Twitter is the fastest growing social media platform and its recomindation algorithm is open source on github so I am able to create a optimized stragedy based on the algorithm.

This allows me to very effectivly target my marketing. I just need to know why my target audance likes, hates, replies to and what time they are on.

After getting this data,  I started tweeting. 

## list problems
As you could predict, I could ran into some problems, including but not limited to:

- consitancy 

- mental exostion 

- 



# Action ( I built an automated twitter system to get leads)





# Result ( without any automation I got leads for a cent each)






# Next steps
