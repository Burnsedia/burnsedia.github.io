# **TLDR: I hate social media, but I need it for marketing**

I hate social media with a passion. It feels fake, performative, and shallow.  
But unfortunately for us introverted autistic nerds, social media has become a business necessity.

So I started researching ways to use social media as a **tool**, not a lifestyle. I focused on Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn.

I have never gotten a single high-quality lead from Instagram or LinkedIn that I’m confident came from an actual human.  
Twitter, on the other hand, has a verification system that gives me a reasonable level of confidence. More importantly, Twitter’s recommendation algorithm is **open source on GitHub**, which means I can analyze it and build a **fully optimized content strategy** around how it actually works.

This lets me target my audience with extreme accuracy. I just need to know:

- what they like  
- what they hate  
- what they reply to  
- when they’re online  

After collecting enough data, I started tweeting consistently.

As expected, I ran into multiple issues, including but not limited to:

- staying consistent  
- mental exhaustion  
- context switching between coding and marketing  
- burnout from trying to “perform” online  
- losing momentum after a few good days  
- spending too much time thinking instead of posting  

I realized that if consistency is the problem, then automation is the solution.

# **I built an automated Twitter system to generate leads**

So I automated the entire thing.

I took an old template from one of my earlier projects, refactored it, and used ChatGPT to help modernize the code. Then I deployed the bot as a cron job on one of my Linux servers.

The bot:

- posts daily tweets  
- rotates tweet types (value, engagement, authority, etc.)  

Essentially, I built an AI-powered marketing system that works 24/7 — even when I’m busy coding.

# Result  
**Without any optimized marketing strategies, I was getting leads for a penny each**

# Next Steps

My next steps include:

- Connecting the bot to my analytics pipeline  
- Turning the bot into a RAG app
- Expanding to LinkedIn and Instagram with platform-specific variations  
- Using LLMs to personalize replies and DMs at scale  
- Turning this into a SaaS with a limited waitlist 
- Building a fully agentic marketing system that can generate value-based content, engage with my audience, and drive traffic to my products automatically
