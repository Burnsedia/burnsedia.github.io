# Brand Manifesto

I build software in public.

Not startup theater. Not polished fiction.  
Real apps, real games, real tools, real constraints.

I care about craft.  
I care about architecture.  
I care about software that does not suck.

I believe technical honesty is a competitive advantage.  
That means showing tradeoffs, not just wins.  
That means documenting mistakes, not hiding them.  
That means choosing long-term quality over short-term hype.

I am building at the intersection of:

- Open source and commercial reality
- Engineering rigor and creative experimentation
- App development, game development, and toolmaking

This is a builder-first brand.

I publish devlogs, deep technical breakdowns, and practical lessons from shipping.
I share what works, what fails, and what I change next.
I build in public so others can build better.

I am not here to perform productivity.
I am here to produce outcomes.

My work is funded by people who value independent builders:
GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, and a community that cares about real execution.

If you want shallow hot takes, this is not that.
If you want practical engineering signal, welcome.

This is the standard:

- No anti-patterns by default
- No fake authority
- No empty optimization
- No corporate-mask storytelling

Just disciplined building, clear thinking, and honest shipping.

Build in public.
Ship with intent.
Keep it real.
