# How to Turn Your GitHub Into a Lead Magnet

## 1️⃣ Story: The Day a Client Found Me Through My Code

I didn’t get my first freelance client from a job board.  
I got it from **GitHub**.

They messaged me after browsing one of my open repositories.  
They said, *“I like how you write code. Can we talk?”*

That single message turned into a long-term contract.  
And it wasn’t luck — it was the result of treating my GitHub like **a landing page**, not a junk drawer.

Your GitHub isn’t just a repo host.  
It’s your **personal brand engine** — one that can generate traffic, authority, and real client work.

## 2️⃣ List: The 5 Ways to Make GitHub Work for You

### 🧠 1. Think Like a Marketer, Not Just a Developer

Every repo you publish tells a story: who you are, what you build, and how you think.  
Don’t just push commits — **position yourself**.  
Decide your theme: Are you “the indie DevOps guy,” “the Django API wizard,” or “the automation engineer”?

Your profile should make that identity obvious at a glance.

### 🧱 2. Make Your Profile README a Sales Page

Your profile README is your homepage on GitHub.  
Structure it like a landing page:

```markdown
# 👋 Hi, I'm Bailey Burnsed
I'm a full-stack developer who helps founders and small businesses build production-ready apps with Django, Vue.js, and Flutter.

- 🧰 Tools: Django · Vue · Astro · Docker · Fly.io  
- 💼 Projects: [Virtue Tracker](https://github.com/Burnsedia/virtue-tracker) · [BulkPost](https://github.com/Burnsedia/bulkpost)  
- 🚀 Hire me: [baileyburnsed.dev](https://baileyburnsed.dev)
```

This instantly turns casual repo visitors into leads.

### 🧾 3. SEO Your Repos

Every GitHub repo is a potential search result.  
To rank higher:

- Use descriptive names: `django-saas-template`, not `app-v2`
- Write human-friendly descriptions
- Add detailed keywords in `topics`
- Link to your site and portfolio in your README

Example:

```markdown
A production-ready Django + Vue.js SaaS template for startups.
Built with TailwindCSS, PostgreSQL, and Docker.
```

These keywords get indexed by Google *and* GitHub search.

### 🧩 4. Turn Projects Into Content

Each repo can fuel multiple posts:

- A blog post (“How I Built X With Django and Vue”)
- A Twitter thread (“I just open-sourced my client onboarding tool…”)
- A YouTube tutorial (“Deploying my Fly.io Django Starter”)

That’s free distribution.  
Write once, promote everywhere.

### ⚙️ 5. Link Everything Together

Create a feedback loop:

- Link GitHub → Website  
- Website → GitHub Repos  
- Blog → GitHub Projects  
- Twitter/LinkedIn → Repos or tutorials  

The result: organic backlinks, better SEO, and higher conversion rates.

## 3️⃣ Steps: The GitHub Lead Magnet System

### Step 1 — Audit Your Profile

- Archive low-value repos  
- Rename useful ones  
- Add topics and keywords  
- Pin 6 projects that match your expertise  

### Step 2 — Add Visuals and READMEs

Use screenshots, GIFs, or demo links.  
Clients love to *see* what you’ve built.  
Make your README look like a one-page pitch deck.

### Step 3 — Add a Hiring CTA

If you’re open to freelance work, **say it explicitly**:

```markdown
💡 Need a developer?  
I build full-stack apps with Django, Vue.js, and Flutter.  
→ [baileyburnsed.dev](https://baileyburnsed.dev)
```

### Step 4 — Automate GitHub Updates

Use GitHub Actions or a cron job to:

- Auto-update your README with latest blog posts  
- Pull follower or commit stats weekly  
- Keep your public profile active  

### Step 5 — Promote Strategically

Share new repos like product launches:
> “Just released a production-ready Django + Vue SaaS starter. Free and open source.”  
> [github.com/Burnsedia/django-vue-template](https://github.com/Burnsedia)

Each launch is a signal to your network that you’re building real products.

## 4️⃣ Lessons Learned

- GitHub is **not** just for developers — it’s a portfolio, blog, and lead generator.  
- The best inbound leads are the ones who’ve *already read your code*.  
- Marketing ≠ manipulation. It’s **showing your work in public**.  
- The fastest way to build authority is to share useful, working code.

## 5️⃣ The GitHub Funnel in Action

Here’s how mine works:

1. Open-source tools → GitHub traffic  
2. README links → My website  
3. Blog posts → SEO and backlinks  
4. Calendly link → Discovery calls  
5. Client work → More tools → More traffic  

It’s a **self-feeding loop**.  
And it’s 100% powered by open source.
