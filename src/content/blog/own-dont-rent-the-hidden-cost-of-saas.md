# Own, Don’t Rent — Why Self-Hosting Beats SaaS for Small Businesses

## 1️⃣ Story: The Subscription Trap

A client once asked me to help them cut costs.  
They were paying for 12 different SaaS products — project management, CRM, analytics, email automation, billing — and their monthly total was over **$1,200**.  

When I looked closer, most of these tools were doing the same thing their website or internal systems could have done for free.  
They didn’t own their data, couldn’t export their customer lists without paying extra, and every “upgrade” added another hidden fee.

That’s when I told them something I tell all my clients:  
> “You don’t need more SaaS. You need sovereignty.”

So we migrated everything to open-source tools.  
Their bill dropped to **$20/month** (for hosting), and they never lost access to their data again.



## 2️⃣ List: Why “Owning” Software Matters

### 🧩 1. Control Your Data
When you rent SaaS, your data lives on someone else’s servers.  
If they shut down or change terms, you’re locked out.  
Self-hosting means *you* decide where your data lives, who accesses it, and how it’s backed up.

### 💸 2. Costs Stay Predictable
SaaS pricing is built to scale *against* you.  
Each new user or feature adds a new monthly charge.  
With self-hosted software, you pay for one VPS and scale it however you want.  

I host most of my clients’ apps on **Fly.io for $5/month** — that’s less than a Netflix subscription.

### 🧠 3. Customization and Flexibility
SaaS tools force you into their workflow.  
Open-source apps let you adapt the tool to *your* business.  
You can integrate, extend, or theme the interface however you want.

Freedom equals speed.

### ⚙️ 4. No Vendor Lock-In
Ever tried canceling a SaaS account?  
You usually lose your data or get hit with “data export” fees.  
With open-source systems like **Wagtail**, **Ghost**, or **Directus**, you own the stack and can move it anywhere — VPS, Docker, or your own NAS.

### 🌐 5. The Indie Advantage
For indie developers, small studios, and agencies, self-hosting creates a moat.  
You can build repeatable systems for clients, host them yourself, and earn recurring revenue — instead of sending it all to third-party platforms.



## 3️⃣ Steps: How to Take Back Ownership of Your Tools

### Step 1 — Audit What You’re Paying For
Make a list of every SaaS product you use.  
Write down:
- What it costs monthly  
- What it actually does  
- Whether you *really need* it  

You’ll be shocked at how much overlap there is.

### Step 2 — Identify Open-Source Replacements
Here are some proven alternatives I’ve deployed for clients:

| SaaS | Self-Hosted Alternative |
|---|--------------------------|
| Notion | **Outline** |
| Airtable | **NocoDB** |
| Trello | **Planka** |
| Wix.com | **Ghost CMS** |
| Zapier | **n8n** |
| Google Analytics | **Plausible** |
| Slack | **Mattermost** |

These tools are free or low-cost, with active communities and Docker images ready to deploy.

### Step 3 — Use Lightweight Hosting
You don’t need AWS bills in the hundreds.  
Platforms like **Fly.io**, **Hetzner**, or **Railway** can host small-business apps for $5–10 per month.  
Add automatic backups and SSL, and you’re production-ready.

### Step 4 — Keep Security Simple
Install updates regularly, enable HTTPS, and use strong passwords or 2FA.  
Open-source doesn’t mean insecure — it just means you’re in charge of updates instead of waiting for someone else.

### Step 5 — Teach Your Team the Why
Once you switch to self-hosting, explain the reasoning to your team.  
They’ll understand that it’s not about saving a few dollars — it’s about independence, privacy, and longevity.



## 4️⃣ The Big Idea: “Own, Don’t Rent”

Owning your software means owning your future.  
When you rent tools, you build someone else’s business.  
When you own them, you build *yours.*

For small businesses and indie founders, self-hosting isn’t just cheaper — it’s smarter.  
It’s how you turn tech from a monthly expense into a long-term asset.
