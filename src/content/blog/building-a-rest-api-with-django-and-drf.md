# Building a REST API with Django and DRF

If Django is the engine of your app, Django REST Framework (DRF) is the transmission ‚Äî it moves data between your frontend and backend with structure and speed.

This tutorial will show you how to build a **fully functional REST API** using Django and DRF ‚Äî the same setup I use for my clients‚Äô apps, SaaS platforms, and mobile APIs.

---

## üß© Why Django REST Framework?

DRF gives you all the essentials:
- Serialization (convert models to JSON)
- Authentication and permissions
- Pagination, filtering, and ordering
- ViewSets and Routers (clean API endpoints)

It‚Äôs perfect for indie devs who want professional-grade APIs without overengineering.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Install Django REST Framework

Assuming you already have a Django project, install DRF:

```bash
pip install djangorestframework
```

Then, add it to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    "rest_framework",
]
```

---

## üß± Step 2: Create a Model

In your `app/models.py` file, define a simple model ‚Äî for example, a `Quote` model:

```python
from django.db import models

class Quote(models.Model):
    text = models.TextField()
    author = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    category = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.author
```

Apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

## üß© Step 3: Create a Serializer

Serializers convert Django models into JSON data your frontend can read.

Create a new file `app/serializers.py`:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Quote

class QuoteSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Quote
        fields = "__all__"
```

---

## üß© Step 4: Create a ViewSet

ViewSets make CRUD endpoints easy.

In `app/views.py`:

```python
from rest_framework import viewsets
from .models import Quote
from .serializers import QuoteSerializer

class QuoteViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Quote.objects.all().order_by("-created_at")
    serializer_class = QuoteSerializer
```

---

## üß≠ Step 5: Register the API Routes

In `app/urls.py`:

```python
from django.urls import path, include
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from .views import QuoteViewSet

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r"quotes", QuoteViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    path("api/", include(router.urls)),
]
```

Then include `app.urls` in your project‚Äôs main `urls.py`:

```python
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("", include("app.urls")),
]
```

---

## üß™ Step 6: Test the API

Run your local server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open your browser and visit:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/quotes/
```

You‚Äôll see DRF‚Äôs interactive API view ‚Äî you can add, edit, or delete quotes directly from the browser.

---

## üîí Step 7: Add Basic Permissions

In `settings.py`, define REST framework defaults:

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    "DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES": [
        "rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny",
    ],
    "DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES": [
        "rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication",
    ],
}
```

Later, you‚Äôll switch to **JWT authentication** (we‚Äôll cover that in the next tutorial).

---

## üß† Optional: Add Pagination and Filtering

Add pagination to your API responses:

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    "DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS": "rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination",
    "PAGE_SIZE": 10,
}
```

Add search or filtering with `django-filter`:

```bash
pip install django-filter
```

Then modify the viewset:

```python
from rest_framework import filters

class QuoteViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Quote.objects.all()
    serializer_class = QuoteSerializer
    filter_backends = [filters.SearchFilter]
    search_fields = ["author", "category"]
```

Now you can search like this:

```
/api/quotes/?search=wisdom
```

---

## üöÄ Step 8: Deploy the API to Fly.io

If you followed the previous tutorial, your Fly.io setup already works.  
You just need to redeploy with your new API changes:

```bash
flyctl deploy
```

Then visit:

```
https://yourapp.fly.dev/api/quotes/
```

Your REST API is now globally available.

---

## üß≠ What‚Äôs Next

From here, you can:
- Add authentication with **Djoser + SimpleJWT**  
- Connect your API to a **Vue.js** or **Flutter** frontend  
- Add background tasks with **Celery and Redis**

This API pattern works for everything ‚Äî SaaS apps, mobile backends, CRMs, and even personal dashboards.

---

## üèÅ Conclusion

Building APIs with Django REST Framework is fast, clean, and scalable.  
You don‚Äôt need heavy frameworks or enterprise tools to serve data ‚Äî just Django, DRF, and a good deployment pipeline.

When you own your stack, you own your business.
