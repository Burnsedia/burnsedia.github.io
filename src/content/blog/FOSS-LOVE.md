I love FOSS—**Free and Open Source Software**—because of the freedom it gives me. I love making art, programming games, and creating other forms of media. In most of the creative industry, software licensing is vague, and I don't like many of the companies behind the tools.

Open source software like **Blender** and **Krita** have clear licenses, so I know exactly what I can and cannot do. There’s no vague wording or hidden clauses. I **own** my art when I use FOSS. In contrast, using tools like Adobe or Autodesk can raise questions about who really owns your work because of unclear or restrictive license terms. Most of the time it’s not a big deal—until it is. And when it is, it’s never good.

I’m also more productive using open source because I can modify the tools to fit my needs. You can't do that with closed-source software. And if you're a small business, you can always hire your nerd friend to tweak, fix, or fork the software to work best for you.
