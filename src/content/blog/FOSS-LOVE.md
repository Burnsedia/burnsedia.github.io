I love FOSS, "Free and Open Source Software," because of the 
freedoms it gives me. I love making art, programming games, and other creative works. For most software in the Creative industry, 
the licensing is vague and I do not like many of the companies that make the software.

Open Source software like Blender and Krita,
are licensed, so I know what I can and cannot do with the software, and there is no vague wording.
I own my art with FOSS; in many cases, your ownership of your work when using Adobe or AutoDesk products can be 
call into question because of the vagueness of the license, 
most of the time it is not a big deal, but when it is, it's never good. 

I am more productive using open source because I can modify it to fit my needs. 
You can not do that with any closed-source software, and if you are a small business, 
you can hire your nerd friend to fix it, tweak it, and fork it to make it work best for you.
