# The Indie Developer Stack 2025 — Django, Vue, Astro, Flutter

## 1️⃣ Story: The Stack That Let Me Go Solo

When I left traditional software jobs and started freelancing full-time, I needed a stack that could do everything:  
- Build APIs fast  
- Create modern, reactive frontends  
- Handle mobile apps with one codebase  
- Deploy cheap and scale when needed  

After years of trial and error, I landed on this:  
**Django + Vue + Astro + Flutter.**

This combination powers every product I build — from MVPs to production SaaS platforms — all while keeping overhead under control.

## 2️⃣ List: Why This Stack Works

### ⚙️ 1. Django — The Backend Backbone
Django is my Swiss Army knife for web development.  
It’s fast to build APIs with **Django REST Framework**, secure out of the box, and has a robust ORM.  
When a client says, “I need something that just works,” I reach for Django.

### 💡 2. Vue.js — The Perfect Middle Ground
Vue gives me just the right balance of power and simplicity.  
It’s easier to learn than React but powerful enough for any app.  
With the **Composition API**, I can write modular, scalable code that plays nice with any backend.

### ⚡ 3. Astro — For Blazing-Fast Websites
Astro is my secret weapon for landing pages, blogs, and marketing sites.  
It’s static-first, JavaScript-optional, and integrates easily with Vue or React.  
It’s the reason my websites score 100 on Lighthouse.

### 📱 4. Flutter — One Codebase, All Devices
When clients need a mobile app, I build it in **Flutter**.  
One codebase covers Android, iOS, desktop, and web.  
And with Dart’s hot reload, I can prototype ideas in minutes.

### 💰 5. All Open Source, All Connected
These tools are open-source, battle-tested, and cost nothing to run.  
Together, they give me enterprise-level power on an indie budget.

## 3️⃣ Steps: How I Use This Stack in Client Projects

### Step 1 — Prototype with Astro
I start by designing the marketing site in Astro to define the brand and funnel.

### Step 2 — Build the API in Django
Next, I spin up a Django REST API to handle authentication, data, and logic.  
I often use **Djoser** or **DRF SimpleJWT** for fast auth setup.

### Step 3 — Add a Vue Frontend
For dashboards, admin panels, or client-facing tools, I connect Vue directly to the Django API.  
Fast feedback, real interactivity.

### Step 4 — Deploy Everything on Fly.io
I use Fly.io or Netlify for small projects.  
Both are cheap, global, and simple to automate with CI/CD pipelines.

### Step 5 — Extend to Mobile with Flutter
When the web version stabilizes, I re-use the API for Flutter mobile apps.  
Users get the same features on every platform — no double maintenance.

## 4️⃣ The Big Idea: Indie Doesn’t Mean Inferior

This stack isn’t about cutting corners — it’s about cutting *waste.*  
You don’t need a team of ten to build production-grade apps.  
You need focus, clarity, and the right tools.
