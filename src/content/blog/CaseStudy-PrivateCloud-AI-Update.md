## Background

Our client initially hosted their SaaS MVP on a public cloud provider. While this setup offered convenience, it quickly became unsustainable—despite having fewer than 100 daily users, the hosting costs were unreasonably high for the size and usage of the project.

## Challenge

The main challenge was to find a more cost-effective infrastructure that could handle up to 10,000 daily users without incurring substantial overage fees.

I evaluated several options. Public cloud providers like Vercel offered a great developer experience but came with a high price tag. Private cloud providers like Hostinger were significantly more affordable but required manual setup and DevOps effort.

## Solution

We migrated the application to a private cloud provider for **$6.99/month**, which included:

- 2 virtual CPU cores  
- 8 GB of RAM  
- 100 GB of NVMe SSD storage  
- 8 TB of bandwidth

A similar configuration with a public cloud provider like Vercel would have cost approximately **$1,220/month**.

To retain the same ease of use that platforms like Vercel and [Fly.io](https://fly.io) provide, I set up a modern CI/CD pipeline using:

- **GitHub Actions** for automated deployments  
- **Docker** for containerization  
- **Watchtower** for automatic container updates

This setup delivered the same developer velocity—at **less than 1% of the cost**.

## Results

- **Cost per user/month (public cloud):** $0.122  
- **Cost per user/month (private cloud):** $0.0007  
- **Savings:** Over **99%** reduction in per-user hosting costs

This made the infrastructure sustainable for early-stage scaling and dramatically reduced burn rate.

## Strategic Insight

Private cloud hosting is ideal for **bootstrapped startups** validating a business idea. With Docker-based deployments, you can scale to 100k daily users on a fixed monthly cost.

When you hit the performance ceiling of your private cloud provider, your app is already Dockerized—making it easy to migrate to scalable public cloud platforms like:

- [Fly.io](https://fly.io)  
- AWS Fargate  
- Google Cloud Run  
- Azure Container Apps

## Recommendation

Use private cloud providers in the early stages of building your SaaS. Once a cost-benefit analysis favors moving, transition to an [Open Cloud Stack-compliant](https://www.opencloud.tech/) public provider.

## Conclusion

Migrating to a private cloud saved over 99% in hosting costs while preserving performance and scalability. This case study shows how a strategic shift in infrastructure can create massive efficiency gains for early-stage startups.
