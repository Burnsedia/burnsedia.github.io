# How I Built an MVP in 7 Days — My Rapid-Dev Process

## 1️⃣ Story: From Idea to App in a Week

A startup founder reached out with a clear problem and a tight deadline:  
> “I need a prototype for my investors — next week.”

No specs, no wireframes, just a rough idea.  
The kind of project most agencies would spend a month scoping before writing a line of code.

Instead, I shipped it in 7 days.  
Fully functional MVP: Django backend, Vue frontend, live on Fly.io with a $5/month server bill.

That’s the difference between working with a process and just writing code.

## 2️⃣ List: The Framework That Makes It Possible

### ⚙️ 1. Start With Proven Tools
When you’ve built enough projects, you learn to stop reinventing the wheel.  
I use the same battle-tested stack for most MVPs:  
- **Django** for the backend and admin panel  
- **Vue.js** for the interactive frontend  
- **Fly.io** for lightning-fast deploys  
- **PostgreSQL** for data integrity  

This stack is simple, scalable, and cost-effective.

### 🧩 2. Focus on Core Functionality
An MVP isn’t a full product — it’s a **testable concept**.  
Every feature should either prove value or gather data.  
If it doesn’t help validate the idea, it doesn’t make it into version one.

I tell clients:  
> “We’re not building forever — we’re building for feedback.”

### 🕹️ 3. Automate the Boring Stuff
Every minute I save on setup is a minute I can spend refining UX.  
So I automate:
- Docker setup  
- Deployment pipelines  
- Environment configuration  
- Dummy data seeding  

My scripts turn “it works on my machine” into “it’s live on production” in one command.

### ⚡ 4. Design for Speed, Not Perfection
MVP design is about clarity, not polish.  
I use simple layouts, DaisyUI components, and modern typography.  
If users understand the flow and can complete tasks, it’s a win.

Good design evolves from usage, not from a Dribbble mockup.

### 📊 5. Validate Early and Iterate Fast
Once the prototype is live, I immediately collect user feedback.  
What’s confusing? What takes too long? What do they actually click?  
That data drives the next iteration — not opinions.

The faster I get real feedback, the sooner the product becomes something people want.

## 3️⃣ Steps: My 7-Day MVP Workflow

Here’s exactly how I break down the process:

### **Day 1 — Scope and Setup**
- Quick call to define core features.  
- Initialize Django + Vue template.  
- Create Docker + Fly.io configs.  

Goal: have the repo deployable by the end of day one.

### **Day 2 — Database and Models**
- Set up PostgreSQL.  
- Define models for core objects (users, posts, events, etc.).  
- Create basic admin panel for internal testing.

Goal: data structure stable enough for the entire project.

### **Day 3 — API Endpoints**
- Build REST endpoints with Django Rest Framework.  
- Add authentication if needed.  
- Test endpoints in Postman or cURL.

Goal: working API that serves the core data.

### **Day 4 — Frontend Foundations**
- Scaffold Vue components.  
- Connect to the API.  
- Set up routing and simple state management.

Goal: users can interact with real data.

### **Day 5 — UI and Styling**
- Add Tailwind + DaisyUI.  
- Create responsive layouts.  
- Polish forms and feedback messages.

Goal: it looks good enough to demo confidently.

### **Day 6 — Deploy and QA**
- Push to Fly.io.  
- Test on staging and production environments.  
- Fix bugs and add analytics.

Goal: live demo link ready for investors.

### **Day 7 — Feedback and Iteration**
- Run a test session with the client.  
- Note issues and UX friction points.  
- Ship small fixes before demo day.

Goal: functional MVP that feels real.

## 4️⃣ The Big Idea: Ship Fast, Learn Faster

Most founders don’t fail because they can’t build — they fail because they **build too slow.**  
Perfectionism kills momentum.  
Speed builds clarity.

By combining a proven stack, automation, and focused goals, I can go from **idea → live app → feedback loop** in under a week.

That’s the real MVP advantage.
