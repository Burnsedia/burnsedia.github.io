# **Own Don’t Rent: 10 Self-Hosted Apps to Use in Your Small Business**

Most small businesses today run on rented tools — SaaS platforms that charge monthly fees and lock you into their ecosystem. Your website, analytics, CRM, and even your email might all live on someone else’s server.

That’s convenient — until it isn’t. When a platform changes its pricing, policy, or shuts down, your business goes with it.

There’s a better way.

By using self-hosted, open-source software, you can own your infrastructure, control your data, and build a stronger, more independent business.

Here are ten powerful apps that let you do exactly that.

## **1. WordPress — Own Your Website**

**Best for:** Websites, blogs, and landing pages

WordPress remains the most flexible way to build your online presence. It powers over 40% of the web, and with self-hosting, it’s entirely yours.  
Customize it, extend it with plugins, and never worry about losing access to your site.

## **2. Chatwoot — Own Your Customer Support**

**Best for:** Live chat and omnichannel support

Chatwoot is an open-source alternative to Intercom and Zendesk. It centralizes messages from email, WhatsApp, Instagram, and your website — all hosted on your own infrastructure.

No data leaks. No vendor lock-in. Just smooth customer communication.

## **3. Plausible Analytics — Own Your Data**

**Best for:** Privacy-friendly website analytics

Plausible replaces Google Analytics with something simple, transparent, and ethical.  
It’s lightweight, cookie-free, and keeps your visitors’ data private — while still giving you the metrics that matter.

## **4. Akaunting — Own Your Books**

**Best for:** Accounting and invoicing

Akaunting is a full accounting suite for freelancers and small businesses.  
Send invoices, track expenses, and manage cash flow — all without sharing financial data with a third party.

**5. Postal — Own Your Email Delivery**

**Best for:** Transactional and marketing emails

Postal lets you run your own email infrastructure — like having your own SendGrid or Mailgun.  
Deliver newsletters and notifications reliably while keeping full control of your sender reputation.

## **6. Nextcloud — Own Your Files**

**Best for:** File storage and team collaboration

Nextcloud gives you a private, self-hosted alternative to Google Drive or Dropbox.  
Share documents, sync files, and even host calendars and chat — all on your own server.

## **7. Snipe-IT — Own Your Equipment**

**Best for:** Asset and inventory management

Snipe-IT helps you keep track of company hardware — laptops, phones, and tools.  
 Know what you own, where it is, and who’s using it, without paying enterprise software fees.

## **8. Monica CRM — Own Your Relationships**

**Best for:** Contact and client management

Monica is a personal CRM that helps you remember the people behind your business — clients, partners, or leads.  
Track notes, birthdays, and follow-ups privately instead of feeding data into a SaaS CRM.

## **The Tools That Make Self-Hosting Easy**

Self-hosting doesn’t mean complexity. With modern tools, anyone can do it.

* Docker Compose — manage all your apps with one YAML file.

* CapRover or Coolify — one-click app deployment platforms.

* Fly.io, Railway, or Hetzner Cloud — affordable cloud hosting for small businesses.

A single $5–$10/month VPS can power most of the tools on this list.

## **Why “Own Don’t Rent” Matters**

Every tool you rent adds another dependency you don’t control. Self-hosting flips that balance — giving you ownership, privacy, and flexibility.

When you own your software stack:

* You control your data.

* You decide your costs.

* You set your own limits.

No subscriptions. No hidden fees. No shutdowns.

Your business deserves stability — not permission slips. So stop renting your tools. Own them.

Own your apps. Own your data. Own your business.
