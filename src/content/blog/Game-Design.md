# Tech Tree - Ship Modules

Do you like ships? Do you like the meta-game of crafting your ships and weapons?  
Well, I have a surprise for you! _The Hive: Interstellar Despot Sim_ is getting a ship crafting and customization system. This new crafting system will allow you to play the way you want.

Modules will have internal slots, mount points, and hardpoints. Internal slots are for subsystems like reactors, fuel tanks, and hangar bays. External hardpoints are for sensors/communication systems, weapons, and engines. Mount points are for adding ship modules.

## Core Modules

- Ship Core
- Ship Forward
- Ship Aft

Ships in this update will have at least three core modules.  
These core modules will have hardpoints that allow sensors, weapons, and hangars for your fighters.

### Ship Cores

Ship cores contain 3 to 5 internal slots, 2 mount points, and 3â€“4 hardpoints to mount external subsystems.

## Advanced Modules

- Hangars
- Command Structure
- Mining Systems
- Station Construction Systems

## Subsystems

- Heat Sinks and Radiators
- Power Generators
- Power Storage
- Cargo Storage
