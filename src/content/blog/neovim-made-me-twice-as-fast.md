# Neovim Made Me Twice as Fast — My Developer Workflow  

## 1️⃣ Story: When VS Code Couldn’t Keep Up  

There was a point where I was typing faster than my editor could handle.  

VS Code started crashing every few hours. Extensions fought for memory.  
Autocompletion lagged. The editor felt heavy — like running a web browser just to type text.  

I realized I had outgrown it.  

So I opened the terminal, installed Neovim, and spent a weekend configuring it.  
Two years later, I’m never going back.  

Neovim didn’t just change *how* I code — it changed *how I think* about coding.  

---  

## 2️⃣ List: Why Neovim Made Me Twice as Fast  

### ⚙️ 1. Instant Startup, Zero Bloat  
Neovim loads faster than my fingers can type `nvim .`  
No Electron. No overhead.  
Just code.  

It runs on everything — my Arch laptop, remote servers, Docker containers, and even a Raspberry Pi.  
I open the same config everywhere, and it feels like home.  

### 🧠 2. Modal Editing = Flow State  
The first thing you learn in Vim is the difference between *Insert Mode* and *Normal Mode*.  
The next thing you learn is that **your hands never have to leave the keyboard again.**  

Text editing becomes muscle memory.  
Deleting a word, moving a block, wrapping text — all become one-second actions instead of ten-second clicks.  

Neovim turns editing into rhythm.  

### 🔌 3. Plugins That Actually Help  
Modern Neovim with **Lua config** means plugins feel integrated, not tacked on.  

My essential stack:  
- **LazyVim / LunarVim** for sane defaults  
- **Telescope** for fuzzy search  
- **nvim-treesitter** for syntax and folding  
- **LSP + Mason** for language servers  
- **Harpoon** for fast file hopping  
- **Lualine** for a slick status bar  

With these, I get IDE-level power inside the terminal.  

### 💻 4. One Editor for Every Language  
I build everything from Django backends to Flutter apps to Godot games.  
Neovim handles them all.  
LSP support means full autocompletion, type hints, and jump-to-definition — no different from VS Code.  

The difference is: it’s all *faster*.  

### 🚀 5. Terminal-First Workflow  
I don’t Alt-Tab anymore.  
My workflow lives entirely in the terminal:  
- Neovim for code  
- LazyGit for version control  
- fzf + ripgrep for search  
- tmux for sessions  

No mouse. No context switching.  
Just raw focus.

## 3️⃣ Steps: How to Build a Neovim Setup That Works  

### Step 1 — Start with Defaults  
Install Neovim from your package manager.  
Use it for a few days with no config.  
Learn the basics:  
- `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` for movement  
- `:wq` to save and quit  
- `/` to search  

Master the fundamentals before adding plugins.  

### Step 2 — Add a Plugin Manager  
I recommend **LazyVim** or **LunarVim**.  
They turn Neovim into a complete IDE out of the box.  
If you prefer manual setup, use **lazy.nvim** and a `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` file.  

### Step 3 — Configure Your Language Servers  
For Python, JavaScript, and Dart, I install:  
\`\`\`bash  
:MasonInstall pyright tsserver dartls  
\`\`\`  
Then I add formatting with:  
\`\`\`bash  
:MasonInstall black prettier  
\`\`\`  

Your LSP config will auto-load with your editor.  

### Step 4 — Integrate Git  
Install **LazyGit** and run it inside tmux.  
It gives you a GUI-style Git dashboard without leaving your terminal.  
Switch branches, stage commits, and push in seconds.  

### Step 5 — Make It Yours  
This is where Neovim shines.  
Add custom keymaps, colorschemes, or autocommands.  
For me, I use a synthwave palette with DaisyUI-inspired colors — my editor literally matches my website.

## 4️⃣ The Big Idea: Tools That Disappear  

Neovim isn’t “cool” because it’s hard.  
It’s powerful because it disappears.  
Once you master the motions, you stop thinking about tools and start thinking about *logic.*  

I don’t measure productivity by lines of code anymore.  
I measure it by how long I can stay in flow.
