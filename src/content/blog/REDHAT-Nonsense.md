TR;DR They Did and not really;
Let me explain.

Redhat Enterprise Linux is a legend in the FOSS space for being 100% Open Source, but it is hard to paywall FOSS code, so they have found interesting workarounds.
Their primary business model is selling support.

That is great, but if you can get the code, you can repackage it, as is their “GNU given right.” If you are new to Linux and Open Source, all open source programs give you the core freedoms:

- The freedom to run the program for any purpose.

- The freedom to study how the program works and modify it

- The freedom to redistribute copies.

- The freedom to distribute copies of modified versions to others.

As you can imagine, this can make it hard for conventional business models.
There were downstream Linux Distros such as CentOS, which was a “bug for bug” compatible Linux OS.

As a result, RedHat acquired and killed off CentOS, and has recently Paywalled the Source Code for the RedHat-specific patches to commonly used open-source software used in RedHat. Paywalling Source code is allowed in the GPL; I do it all the time for apps I make. The problem is that:

1. RedHat doesn’t own 100% of the source code of the patches

2. RedHat requires you to sign a license that conflicts with the GPL

This has led the Free Software Conservatory to File a Lawsuit, which is meant to protect the rights of the contributors to the open-source projects that received the RedHat-specific patches and enforced GPL license compliance.

The restrictions added by RedHat are the problem; you can do that. The problem is that added restrictions on top of the GPL effectively make RedHat a closed-source operating system. This new practice has destroyed all the company's remaining good faith and has led to many companies and communities switching to other Linux distros for your server needs.

RedHat insists they are following the GPL, but in truth, they are, but mulishly. RedHat has turned to mulish compliance in the past, but never to this extent. This time it may cost them. This has led to losing customers, hurting their support and subscription-based business model.
