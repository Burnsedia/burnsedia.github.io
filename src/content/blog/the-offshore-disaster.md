# The Offshore Disaster — Why Cheap Code Costs More

## 1️⃣ Story: The $20,000 That Bought Nothing

A client once came to me completely defeated.  
They had paid an offshore “agency” over **$20,000** to build their app.  
What they got looked fine in screenshots — but when I opened the repo, I realized the truth.

The app *only ran on the developers’ laptops.*  
No deployment scripts. No documentation. No version control history that made sense.  
Half the features didn’t even connect to the backend.

They hadn’t bought a product.  
They had bought a **PowerPoint demo that pretended to be software.**

So I rebuilt it from scratch in a week.

## 2️⃣ List: What I Learned About Offshore Development

### 🧱 1. “Cheap” Developers Are Expensive Long-Term
When the main goal is to cut costs, quality is always the first casualty.  
Your first dollar saved turns into five spent on rewrites, delays, and missed launches.  
In the end, my client paid **twice** — once for the broken code, once for the rebuild.

### 💬 2. Communication Is Everything
Offshore teams often work in different time zones, speak different business languages, and rely on middlemen.  
By the time your request reaches the coder, it’s gone through three translators and two spreadsheets.  
That’s not a recipe for innovation — it’s a recipe for frustration.

### 🧩 3. Accountability Gets Lost in Translation
When a project is run by a rotating team of anonymous developers, no one feels responsible.  
No one “owns” the product.  
When something breaks, the finger-pointing starts — and you’re left holding the bag.

### 🕹️ 4. Cultural Fit Matters More Than You Think
Software isn’t just code — it’s communication.  
If your developer doesn’t understand your customers, your business model, or your culture, you’ll spend all your time explaining *why* something matters instead of shipping it.

### ⚙️ 5. Onshore = Alignment
When you work directly with someone who shares your language, time zone, and context, things move faster.  
You can have real conversations, not translated tickets.  
It’s not about nationality — it’s about *alignment of goals.*

## 3️⃣ Steps: How to Avoid the Offshore Trap

### Step 1 — Hire for Accountability
Find one developer or a small, consistent team.  
Ask, “Who writes the code?” and “Who deploys it?”  
If those are two different people, think twice.

### Step 2 — Own the Codebase
Always have access to:
- The repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)  
- Deployment credentials  
- Documentation and API keys  

If you don’t control the repo, you don’t own the product.

### Step 3 — Pay for Deliverables, Not Hours
Hourly billing incentivizes time, not results.  
Set milestones tied to working features.  
If someone can’t show you progress on staging or production — they’re not shipping.

### Step 4 — Start Small, Test Quickly
Before committing big money, hire for a short paid test project.  
Ask them to deploy something small to production.  
If they can’t do that smoothly, don’t move forward.

### Step 5 — Value Trust Over Price
Your software is the backbone of your business.  
The cheapest option rarely stays cheap.  
Invest in people who understand that your time and trust are worth more than a discount.

## 4️⃣ The Big Idea: The Real Cost of “Cheap”

The real cost of cheap development isn’t the money — it’s the **lost momentum.**  
Every week spent fixing broken code is a week your idea isn’t in the market.

My client learned that the hard way.  
You can learn it the smart way.

If you want to build software the right way — clearly, transparently, and fast — skip the offshore roulette.
