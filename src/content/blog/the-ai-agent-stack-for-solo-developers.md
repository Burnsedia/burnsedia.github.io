# The AI Agent Stack for Solo Developers

## 1️⃣ Story: How I Started Replacing Busywork With Agents

I used to spend half my day on things that weren’t coding —  
marketing, replying to DMs, writing content, managing leads, posting updates.  

Then I built a simple **Twitter bot**.  
Eighty-one lines of Python that posted my thoughts every two hours and forty minutes.  
That tiny script became the seed of something bigger —  
a full **agentic AI system** that now handles my content, analytics, and client outreach automatically.

That’s when I realized:  
**AI isn’t just for companies — it’s leverage for solo developers.**



## 2️⃣ List: The Core of an Agentic Stack

Here’s what powers my setup, the same system behind **BulkPost 2.0**:

### 🧠 1. PydanticAI for Structured Reasoning
I use **PydanticAI** to define agent schemas — typed prompts that return clean, validated data.  
No more unpredictable “chatty” AI outputs.

Now every AI response is predictable and reusable across systems.



### ⚙️ 2. Django as the Brain
Every agent runs as a **Django service** with Celery tasks.  
The architecture looks like this:
- Django API → task queue → AI agent  
- Results → stored in Postgres  
- Triggers → push to social APIs or dashboards  

This turns Django into a **command center** for automation.



### 🧱 3. BulkPost: The Marketing Layer
BulkPost started as a scheduling tool.  
Now I am developing it into an **AI-driven social engine**.  

It:
- Plans daily content  
- Generates captions  
- Posts 12 times a day via cron  
- Tracks engagement  
- Adjusts tone based on performance  

Each piece of content is generated by agents working together:
- **Planner Agent** (topic selection)  
- **Writer Agent** (tone + style)  
- **Analyst Agent** (engagement learning)  
- **Reply Agent** (auto engagement with followers)



### 🌐 4. Cron + VPS + Fly.io = Always-On Automation
My AI stack runs in layers:
- **Local Dev:** run tasks in Docker  
- **VPS:** cron jobs every 160 minutes for bot posting  
- **Fly.io:** global deployment for scale and monitoring  

Each container runs its own isolated task runner:
```bash
*/160 * * * * /usr/bin/env bash -lc 'cd /home/bailey/bulkpost && /usr/bin/python3 twitter81.py >> twitter.log 2>&1'
```

Twelve posts a day. Zero effort. Infinite reach.



### 🤖 5. Ollama + OpenAI + PydanticAI Bridge
Locally, I use **Ollama** for private inference and **OpenAI** for production-grade quality.  
PydanticAI gives me a unified interface, so switching models is seamless.

The hybrid model keeps costs low while maintaining creative diversity —  
one local model for draft generation, another for refinement.



## 3️⃣ Steps: Building Your Own Agent Stack

### Step 1 — Start Small
Automate one annoying task.  
Maybe it’s tweeting, sending follow-ups, or summarizing Slack messages.  
Write one Python script that does it automatically.

### Step 2 — Wrap It in Django
Turn it into an API or background job.  
This gives you a structured base for adding more agents later.

### Step 3 — Add PydanticAI for Reliability
Define schemas so every AI output has structure.  
Your agents will stop hallucinating and start behaving predictably.

### Step 4 — Deploy It on a VPS
Don’t overengineer.  
A $5/month VPS can run your agent system just fine until you’re ready to scale.

### Step 5 — Scale on Fly.io
Once it’s stable, move your containers to Fly.io for global uptime and distributed task runners.  
Now your agents work while you sleep — everywhere.



## 4️⃣ The Philosophy: Build Leverage, Not Workload

AI isn’t about replacing developers — it’s about multiplying them.  
As a solo dev, I don’t need a team of 10 people.  
I need one good **stack** that does the repetitive tasks for me.  

That’s what agentic systems are for:
- Less context switching  
- More creative time  
- Consistent output  
- Exponential leverage  

This is how solo developers compete with companies.



## 5️⃣ Lessons Learned

- Treat every automation like an employee: define its job, limits, and success metrics.  
- AI doesn’t need to be fancy — it needs to be consistent.  
- Cron + Docker + Django = reliable agent infrastructure.  
- PydanticAI is the bridge between “AI ideas” and “production systems.”  

The more agents you create, the more time you buy back.  
That’s real freedom.
