# üè¥ Cypherpunk Manifesto

## I. Identity

-   I grew up online --- IRC, mailing lists, and text-to-speech helped
    me overcome dyslexia.
-   I was called "crazy" for saying we already live in a cyberpunk
    dystopia.
-   I see what others miss: structures, control systems, artificial
    scarcity.
-   I wasn't crazy. I was early.

## II. The System

-   Elites want markets for them, not for us.
-   Property, information, and even freedom are treated as
    **privileges**, not rights.
-   The state and corporations collude to control resources, speech, and
    opportunity.
-   Capitalism warped into cronyism. Socialism warped into bureaucracy.
-   What we live under now isn't capitalism or socialism.
-   It's **totalitarian corporatism**: authoritarian control in the mask
    of democracy.

## III. Scarcity & Abundance

-   Scarcity of land and raw resources real. Scarcity of refined and manufactured goods is artificial.
-   Housing, food, and medicine exist in abundance but are hoarded,
    zoned, and paywalled.
-   Information is post-scarcity --- but DRM and copyright laws enforce
    digital cages.
-   AI will be the next battleground of enforced scarcity vs.¬†open
    abundance.

## IV. Open Source: Capitalism Perfected

-   Open source is a true free-market without gatekeepers.
-   Value comes from what you create and share --- not what you hoard.
-   Profit is honest: from service, hosting, customization, not
    artificial scarcity.
-   Linux, Python, PostgreSQL, Sqlite , Ollama, PGP: the backbone of real
    freedom.

## V. Optimism

-   Privacy is no longer "weird" --- it's responsible.
-   Linux is mainstreaming --- Steam Deck, Android, servers.
-   Event PewDiePie switched to Arch Linux, this is proof that Linux, 
    Open Source and Self Hosting is ready for the mainstream.
-   Open source is winning, even when corporations fight it.
-   Decentralization is alive in federated systems, even if small.
-   The counterculture is growing.

## VI. Declaration

-   We live in a cyberpunk dystopia.
-   But we don't just imagine it --- we resist it, subvert it, and build
    alternatives.
-   **Freedom isn't given. It's built.**
