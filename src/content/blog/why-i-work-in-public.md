# Why I Work in Public — How Transparency Builds Trust

## 1️⃣ Story: Sharing My Process Changed Everything

I used to code in silence — build, ship, move on.  
Then I started posting progress logs on Twitter and LinkedIn.  
People didn’t just follow — they reached out.

Clients said things like:  
> “I love how open you are about your work. It made me trust you instantly.”

Now I treat transparency as part of my business model.

## 2️⃣ List: Why Building in Public Works

### 💬 1. People Buy from People They Know
When you share your work, people feel like they already know you.  
Trust builds before the sale even starts.

### 🧠 2. You Attract the Right Clients
Public work filters clients automatically.  
People who like your process reach out; those who don’t, self-select out.

### ⚙️ 3. Feedback Comes Early
When you share your work-in-progress, people point out issues *before* launch.  
That feedback saves weeks of revisions.

### 🚀 4. Public Work = Social Proof
Every commit, screenshot, or update becomes proof of consistency.  
You don’t need testimonials when you have a public track record.

### 🌱 5. You Build Community, Not Just Traffic
Over time, followers turn into collaborators, and collaborators turn into clients.

## 3️⃣ Steps: How to Build in Public Without Oversharing

### Step 1 — Start Small
Post one update per week.  
Share something real — a lesson, a bug fix, a refactor, or a win.

### Step 2 — Focus on Value
Don’t just post what you did.  
Post *why* it mattered or *what* you learned.

### Step 3 — Document, Don’t Perform
Keep it authentic.  
No fake “launches.”  
Just real work, real learning.

### Step 4 — Cross-Post
Use your blog for long-form, then summarize on LinkedIn and Twitter.  
It multiplies reach without multiplying work.

### Step 5 — Engage Back
Respond to comments.  
That’s how you turn followers into fans.
