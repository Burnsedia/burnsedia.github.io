# From Games to SaaS — What Godot Taught Me About Product Design

## Context

Before I built SaaS apps, I built games.

My first big side project was a space strategy game in **Godot** — part FPS, part tower defense.
Every system needed to interact: AI logic, player input, UI, resource management, performance optimization.
It forced me to think about *how* systems communicate — and what happens when they don’t.
That mindset completely transformed how I now design SaaS products.
## What Works

### User Experience Is Gameplay
In games, you live or die by how it feels to use your system.
If controls are clunky or feedback is delayed, players quit.
Software is no different.
The user interface *is* the product.

### Systems Need Clear Boundaries
Game entities are like microservices: small, reusable, and specialized.
In SaaS, the same rule applies — APIs should communicate clearly without side effects.
The fewer hidden dependencies, the easier it is to debug and scale.

### Feedback Loops Build Retention
In games, players stay engaged because the system constantly gives feedback:
hit markers, XP bars, level-ups.
In SaaS, you can do the same thing with metrics, notifications, and success states.
Every click should lead to a small win.

### Polish Last, Test First
Game dev taught me that premature polish is wasted effort.
Get the core loop working first, then add animations.
Same for SaaS — build the workflow, then make it pretty.

### MVP ≠ Minimum Viable UI
Most games start as gray boxes.
SaaS should too.
Launch early, get feedback, and iterate.
## Implementation Approach

### Step 1 — Define the Core Loop
Ask: what’s the user’s repeatable cycle?
For example, in a CRM:
1. Add contact
2. Send message
3. Close sale
If that loop feels rewarding, everything else can wait.

### Step 2 — Map the Systems
List the entities and their interactions.
Treat them like in-game objects: clear inputs, outputs, and rules.

### Step 3 — Prototype Fast
Use mock data, placeholder assets, or dummy endpoints.
Don’t over-engineer before the loop works.

### Step 4 — Add Feedback and Flow
Make the product *feel alive.*
Use toasts, progress bars, and animations to keep users in flow.

### Step 5 — Playtest With Real Users
In game dev, playtesting reveals everything.
In SaaS, it’s user testing.
Ship early, observe behavior, iterate relentlessly.
