# The One Developer Agency Model  

Most developers dream of running their own agency, but very few actually do.  
They get stuck managing people instead of shipping software.  

Here’s the truth: you don’t need a team of ten to run a six-figure software company.  
You just need systems, automation, and focus.

---

## 🧩 The Concept  

The “One Developer Agency” model is simple:  
one person, many systems.  

You operate like an agency — with clients, retainers, and deliverables —  
but you use automation and templates to scale yourself.  

This is the model behind **BaileyBurnsed.dev**:  
I build, deploy, and maintain software for multiple clients — alone —  
without burnout or chaos.  

---

## 💼 The Structure  

1. **Productized Services** –  
   Every client gets the same structure: one fixed monthly rate, one Trello board, one feature at a time.  
   This creates predictable workload and revenue.

2. **Automated Systems** –  
   Tasks like onboarding, invoicing, and deployment are handled by scripts or n8n workflows.  

3. **Templates & Reuse** –  
   Django + Vue + Docker + Fly.io form a reusable base.  
   New clients mean configuration, not reinvention.  

4. **Transparent Communication** –  
   Minimal meetings. Async updates through Trello or email.  

---

## ⚙️ The Tools  

- **Backend:** Django / Django Rest Framework  
- **Frontend:** Vue 3 / Astro / Tailwind CSS  
- **Mobile:** Flutter  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions + Fly.io  
- **Automation:** n8n + Python scripts  
- **Project Management:** Trello / Notion  

Each tool automates something that normally requires staff.

---

## 📈 Why It Works  

- **Predictable Revenue:** Flat monthly pricing.  
- **No Overhead:** No payroll, no meetings, no HR.  
- **Focus on Output:** Clients care about results, not hours.  
- **Speed:** Templates + automation = MVPs in weeks, not months.  

The “One Developer Agency” model is about optimizing for output and autonomy — not growth for growth’s sake.  

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned  

- Scope creep dies when you enforce one task at a time.  
- Clients value certainty more than complexity.  
- Most meetings can be emails.  
- You don’t need employees to deliver enterprise-level quality.  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion  

You don’t need to hire to scale.  
You need to simplify.  

The One Developer Agency Model lets you build fast, deliver predictably, and stay free — without sacrificing quality or income.  

If you want to build software that scales without building a team, this model is for you.
