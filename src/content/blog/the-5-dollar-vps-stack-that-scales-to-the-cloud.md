# The $5 VPS Stack That Scales to the Cloud

## 1️⃣ Story: The Power of Starting Small

When I tell people I still run most of my early-stage projects on a $5 VPS, they look at me like I’m stuck in 2010.  
But here’s the thing: starting small is the smartest way to move fast.

You don’t need Kubernetes to validate your app.  
You don’t need AWS just to host an MVP.  
You need something cheap, simple, and fully under your control — a **VPS**.

For me, that means **Hostinger**, **Linode**, or **Fly.io’s** basic machines.  
Once a project takes off, I don’t rewrite anything.  
I just **push the same Docker containers to Fly.io** and scale horizontally.  
It’s that simple.

---

## 2️⃣ List: My $5 VPS Stack

Here’s the baseline stack I use for almost every new project:

### 🐳 1. Docker
Containerize everything.  
Your local environment = your production environment.  
No “it works on my machine” excuses.

### 🐍 2. Django Backend
Handles your API, admin panel, and user management.  
Run it with `gunicorn` + `nginx` inside Docker for a lightweight, production-ready setup.

### ⚙️ 3. PostgreSQL Database
Reliable, easy to back up, and runs great on low-resource VPS instances.  
For small projects, even SQLite can work until traffic grows.

### 🌐 4. Vue.js Frontend
Builds fast static bundles you can serve through `nginx` or a CDN later.  
Pairs perfectly with Django REST.

### 💾 5. Redis Queue (Optional)
If you need async tasks or caching, spin up Redis in a small Docker container.  
It barely uses memory at MVP scale.

---

## 3️⃣ Steps: From Local to VPS to Fly.io

### Step 1 — Local Development
Write your app locally, test everything in Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
Make sure the stack runs cleanly: Django, Vue, PostgreSQL, Redis.

### Step 2 — Deploy to a $5 VPS
Spin up a VPS and install Docker:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
```

Copy your files and run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
That’s it. You’re live.

### Step 3 — Add a Domain + HTTPS
Point your domain’s A record to the VPS IP.  
Then use **Caddy** or **NGINX + Certbot** for HTTPS:
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
```

### Step 4 — Scale to Fly.io
Once you outgrow the VPS:
```bash
fly launch
fly deploy
```
Fly will detect your Dockerfile, build it, and deploy globally.  
You get edge routing, scaling, and metrics — with the same exact stack.

### Step 5 — Use Both
You don’t have to choose.  
Use the VPS for prototypes, staging, or microservices.  
Use Fly.io for scaling or global redundancy.

## 4️⃣ Lessons Learned

- **Start simple, scale smart.** Don’t pay for what you’re not using.  
- **Same stack, everywhere.** Docker makes migration frictionless.  
- **VPS ≠ old school.** It’s the foundation of cloud-native thinking.  
- **Control = Confidence.** You know what’s running and where.  

---

## 5️⃣ Why This Matters

Cloud platforms are great, but they encourage **premature scaling**.  
You end up spending more time configuring clusters than serving users.

The VPS → Docker → Fly.io workflow lets me:
- Ship faster
- Keep costs under $10/month
- Scale globally when needed
- Stay fully self-reliant

It’s not about being cheap — it’s about being **efficient**.
