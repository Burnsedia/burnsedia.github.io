# 27 Percent Conversion — Lessons from Selling Software in Person

## Selling Code Face-to-Face

Most developers hide behind screens.  
I used to do the same — hoping clients would magically appear through SEO or referrals.

But one day, I started pitching in person.  
Coffee shops, co-working spaces, networking events.  
And my conversion rate shot up to **27%.**

I didn’t use a script. I just explained *how I work* and *why it’s different.*

## Why In-Person Sales Work

### 1. People Buy Energy

Clients don’t understand code — they understand confidence.  
When they meet you, they feel your conviction.  
You’re not selling syntax; you’re selling certainty.

### 2. Real Conversations Beat Perfect Funnels

No ad or landing page beats a 10-minute human conversation.  
When people ask questions, you adapt.  
You learn what matters most to them — and what doesn’t.

### 3. Transparency Builds Trust

I lead with my pricing: $4000/month, flat rate.  
No hidden fees, no contracts.  
That honesty disarms people and filters out tire-kickers instantly.

### 4. Simplicity Sells

Most freelancers overcomplicate their pitch.  
Mine is simple:  
> “You pay me $4000, I build your software for 30 days.”  
No jargon. Just clarity.

### 5. Proof > Promises

When I show past work, open-source repos, or even code snippets, clients *get it.*  
They see results, not résumés.

## How to Sell Like a Developer

### Step 1 — Know Your Offer
If you can’t explain your service in one sentence, it’s not clear enough.  
Write it down until it feels obvious.

### Step 2 — Lead With the Process
People fear the unknown.  
Show them what working with you looks like: Trello, weekly updates, and clarity.

### Step 3 — State the Price Early
Never make clients guess.  
Good clients respect transparency.  
Bad ones walk away (which saves you time).

### Step 4 — Show Real Work
Keep screenshots, short demos, or GitHub links handy.  
Show how your work *solves problems.*

### Step 5 — Follow Up
Most deals close after the third interaction.  
Don’t ghost — stay consistent.

## The Big Idea: Selling Is Just Helping

You’re not “selling” — you’re guiding people toward a solution.  
When you believe in what you do, sales becomes service.
