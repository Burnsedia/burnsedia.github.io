# The Problem with Agencies — Why Solo Developers Deliver Better

## 1️⃣ Story: When “Big Teams” Build Small Results

A client hired me to fix a project managed by a 10-person agency.  
They had 5 project managers and 3 designers — but no working code.

After three months and $15,000, they had nothing deployed.  
I rebuilt the app in two weeks.

That’s when I realized: most agencies are *meetings in disguise.*

## 2️⃣ List: Why Solo Developers Outperform

### 🧠 1. Communication Is Direct
When you hire one developer, you talk to the person doing the work.  
No layers of management. No confusion. Just progress.

### 💸 2. Lower Overhead = Faster Delivery
Agencies spend your money on internal Slack threads, meetings, and handoffs.  
Solo devs spend it on shipping features.

### ⚙️ 3. Ownership Creates Accountability
When I’m the only one building, I can’t hide behind a team.  
It’s my code, my name, my responsibility.

### 💬 4. Fewer Handoffs, Fewer Bugs
Every time code changes hands, bugs multiply.  
Fewer people = fewer errors = faster iteration.

### 🚀 5. Clients Get Results, Not Reports
You don’t need another progress report.  
You need your app working.  
That’s what solo devs deliver.

## 3️⃣ Steps: How to Hire Better Developers

### Step 1 — Find Builders, Not Brokers
Hire people who write code, not just talk about it.

### Step 2 — Ask for a Deployment Plan
Anyone can promise results.  
Ask how they’ll ship them.

### Step 3 — Check Their Repos
If a developer can’t show open-source work, proceed with caution.

### Step 4 — Keep Communication Simple
Use Trello, weekly updates, and one clear channel.

### Step 5 — Reward Results, Not Time
Pay for working software — not hours logged.

## 4️⃣ The Big Idea: Small Teams, Big Impact

The future of software isn’t in bloated agencies — it’s in focused builders.  
Hire people who *ship,* not people who schedule meetings.
