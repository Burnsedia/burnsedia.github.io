<p class="mb-5">
	  I am your typical autistic nerd who rents a basement apartment and freelances on web development.
    I am also a digital artist, a cyber security freak, and a moonlight game developer. I develop 
    free and open-source software for my personal use and to help make the world a safer place.
    I believe that I can make a difference in the world by educating people and how to keep what 
    little privacy and freedom we still have. I am also a firm believer that you can make a living 
    developing FOSS applications and Art.

    Self Tough and Collage Experience
  </h3>
	<p class="mb-5">
	  I began programming at around 7 years old, making mods to video games like Command and Conquer
    and Sid Mirs Civilisation. I first started working professionally as a mear programmer building Python
    Web Scraping and Web Crawling scripts to gather data for local small businesses in Peachtree City GA, USA.
    At that time I was also a local Digital artist who made small animations and logos for local family-owned
    coffee shops and farmers market vendors. Then I built a Full Stack WebApp in Django through it on the web and well
    I have not been a professional artist since.

	<p class="mb-5">
	  I am currently in the process of getting my BS in Computer science. I plan to transfer to  GA Tech after getting my AS in CS.
    In the meantime, I am getting Certifications and building a few SaaSs here and there. I strive for greatness every day and I
    love helping others achieve their goals.

    Hobbies and Goals 
  </h3>
	
	<p class="mb-5">
  	My hobbies included making breathtaking renders of Space Scaps and Sci Fi 3d scenes. I use only open-source tools like Blender, Krita, 
    and Inkscape to make my art. I moonlight as a game developer building Rouglikes, Space Shooters, and 4x games. I am currently trying to combine all 
    these genres into a single game or series of games using the same real-time database to be in a shared universe. 
	</p>
	<p class="mb-5">
    I also build and contribute to open source projects that I feel are making a difference in the world making it a safer and more secure place. 
    I also love making educational material like Tutorials and Courses that help people learn new things and expand their horizons.
