      Why I build
    <p class="text-lg text-base-content/70 mb-8 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
      I build software the way I wish it existed.
      <br /><br />
      Tools that respect users.
      Games that prioritize mechanics over hype.
      Open source that teaches, not just trends.
      <br /><br />
      Most of what I ship is built in public —
      because leverage matters more than lock-in.
      <br /><br />
      If you care about systems, autonomy, and craft,
      you’re in the right place.
