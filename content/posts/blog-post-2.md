excerpt: Going Full Time as a Developer
---

I have Gone Full time as a freelance developer and cyber security consultant. I have been dreaming about 
becoming a full time developer, developing my own SaaS, Apps and Games. Well enough dreaming, time to getwork. I am throughing myself at this, I have desided to make this my lifes perpus. I love to program, I love to learn and to build things. 

# Freelancing vs Building my own SaaS?

Well, Why not both. I can help people with there Website needs and cyber security conserns. I am building
my pricay focuased apps and building quallity games, that do not spy on you and sell your data.
I fell that all the apps these days, are a massive security risk. I am developing apps that normal peoplecan use and is not spyware

## From a love of Code to a Career!! 

I started programming as a kid, making mods to Civ5 and Command and Conquer. When I was in high school, Istarted freelancing web development with Djangoa and WordPress, I loved it. It was easier to get work in that small town, I did have much issues with my Autism, that was never a problom in tech, until I got to the big city, I had a massive challenge, other nerds, with more experiance with poeple.

I got past the challenge of negosationg with people, I took a long time. I fownd people, that I can understand and I know have friends and calleges, that I can work with and I love to learn network. So I started freelancing again and I am now supporting myself as a dev. I am building and selling apps, games, and I am building a SaaS to help people with managing your privacy.

A massive thank you to all the people who have help me regain my love for code and start my life.
