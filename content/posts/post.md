# Going Pro

I have Gone Full time as a freelance developer and cyber security consultant. I have been dreaming about 
becoming a full time developer, developing my own SaaS, Apps and Games. Well enough dreaming, time to get to work. I am throwing myself at this, I have decided to make this my life's purpose. I love to program, I love to learn and to build things. 

# Freelancing vs Building my own SaaS?

Well, Why not both. I can help people with there Website needs and cyber security concerns. I am building
my privacy focused apps and building premium(Paid for) games, that do not spy on you and sell your data.
I fell that all the apps these days, are a massive security risk. I am developing apps that normal people can use and that is not spyware

## From a love of Code to a Career!! 

I started programming as a kid, making mods to Civilization 5 and Command and Conquer. 
When I was in high school, I started freelancing web development with Django, and WordPress. I fell in loved it.
I found it easier to work as a freelance web developer because my Autism makes it easier for me to understand computers and software systems

But that is not to say there were no challenges, there were to many to count. negosationg prices is was a big one.
I got past the challenge of negosationg with people, I took a long time. I found people, that I can understand and I know have friends and calleges, that I can work with and I love to learn network. So I started freelancing again and I am now supporting myself as a dev. I am building and selling apps, games, and I am building a SaaS to help people with managing your privacy.

A massive thank you to all the people who have help me regain my love for code and start my life.
