### Game Dev  

I am building a mobile Space Shooter game for Android and Web with the Godot Game Engine. 
I am doing to to help me prepare for my Google Android Developer Certification. The game is a Tower Defense game from a, 
tactical pause mode. 

The game is inspired by WingComander, and House of the Ding Sun, It is a hard sci-fi setting, no F.T.L. travel or commination but you are Trans-Human Cyborg than,
can handle 10k G's of acceleration and change your sense of time to allow for commination across the local star cluster.
