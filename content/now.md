### Game Dev  

I am building a mobile Space Shooter game for Android and Web with the Godot Game Engine. 
I am doing to to help me prepare for my Google Android Developer Certification. The game is a Tower Defense game from a, 
tactical pause mode. 

The game is inspired by WingCommander, and House of the Ding Sun, It is a hard sci-fi setting, no F.T.L. travel or commination but you are Trans-Human Cyborg than,
can handle 10k G's of acceleration and change your sense of time to allow for commination across the local star cluster.

### Database and BlockChain Dev

I started porting the Gunjs to rust. Gunjs is a decentralized graph database, using web sockets to connect different nodes in the graph on
different devices. The Gunjs is a realtime database, I can use this for large scale apps and Games. I plan to use Gunjs for my game Sector Defense,
and Interstellar Despot Sim.
