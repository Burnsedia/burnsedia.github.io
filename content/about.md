 I am your typical autistic nerd, that makes CLI applications in rust and Games in Godot Engine, and in Rust. 
 This is my blog were I go over how I became a self taught developer, with just blood, sweet and lots of coffee.
 I also make Tutorial on Rust and Godot engine, Python frameworks. I love Tech, art and music. 

 I love to learn about new tech, discoveries in physics and biology.
